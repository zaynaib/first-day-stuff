## What is Git and why is it important for programmers

Git is a software system that trackes changes in computer files.
Knowing Git will increase the development workflow on any project you are doing. Instead of saving mulitple copies of files on your 
computer and keeping track of changes on your own. You can use git to keep track. If you are working alone its not necessary to upload your files onto an
online hosting service like Github, BitBucket and many others.You can keep your work on you local computer. But if you are working with multiple individuals you should use a hosting 
service. You can pair git with a wicked text editor,a program used to edit files, such as Visual Code and Atom

## Git WorkFlow

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "My really important message"
git push

```

git status -checks to see if you there are any changes your working directory
git add . -adds all of your changes to your working directory
git commit -m  "my message" - commits the changes in your working directory 
git push - adds your changes to a remote branch

##Sharing + Updating Projects

git fetch - to see if there are any changes upload to a branch you want to get files from
git pull - to retrieve all the changes from a branch

## Git Merge Conflicts
They are going to happen just get use to it.
